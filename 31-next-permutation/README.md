# 31-next-permutation

One way is to Calculate all the permutations and then check the permutations
for that sort the array first and then produce permutations
    Swap Permutaions Doesn't give Permutaions Lexicographically
    So, Can't use this

Second way is created by observation which is traverse permutation from back
and check for increasing subsequence from back.
